## Introduction

A decentralized identity management has emerged as a pivotal component for enhancing security, privacy, and user control. However, zkSync, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, zkSync provides high throughput and low-cost transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of building a decentralized identity management system on zkSync and a step-by-step guide to implementing a robust identity management solution on zkSync era.

## Project Setup

To setup the project, we will scaffold it with [zkSync cli](https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/zksync-cli/commands/create.html#contracts) for easy set up.

Head over to your command prompt or terminal and run the code below:

`npx zksync-cli create`

You will be prompted to enter your project's name. You can enter your desired project's name, in our case `IdentityManagement`.

Next, you will be prompted to select the type of project. Select `Contracts` and proceed. 

After that, select `Ethers V6` as ethereum framework and select `Hardhat + Solidity` as Template.

You will be prompted to enter `private key` or set it later. For this tutorial,leave it blank and continue.

Finally, select your desired package manage to begin installations.

This will create a new zkSync era project named `IdentityManagement`. Some examples contracts,tests and deployment will be generated by default. However, for the purposes of this tutorial, we don't need the example contracts related files. So, proceed by removing all the files inside the /contracts , /test folders manually or by running the following commands:

`cd IdentityManagement `
`rm -rf ./contracts/*`
`rm -rf ./test/*`

Finally, create a file named `IdentityManagement.sol` inside your `contracts` folder.

## Smart Contract Overview

The Identity `identityManagemen` smart contract serves as the backbone of our decentralized identity management system. This contract, written in Solidity, allows users to manage their identities securely on the zkSync network. 

Below is the the complete smart contract code for this project :

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IdentityVerification {

    /**
     * @dev Struct representing an identity.
     * @param user The address of the user.
     * @param name The name of the user.

     * @param exists Indicates if the identity exists.
